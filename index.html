      <h1>Code Display - Finding a negative cycle in the graph</h1>
      <blockquote>Negative edge weights are found in various applications of graphs, hence the usefulness of this algorithm. If a graph contains a "negative cycle" (i.e. a cycle whose edges sum to a negative value) that is reachable from the source, then there is no cheapest path: any path that has a point on the negative cycle can be made cheaper by one more walk around the negative cycle. In such a case, the Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm can detect and report the negative cycle.
